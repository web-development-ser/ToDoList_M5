# Collaborative Shopping List ToDoList
### ```Final Project M5: Programmers of Tomorrow```

A simple and collaborative application for creating shopping lists, where users can share and manage shopping lists with friends or family in real-time. Ideal for organizing supermarket purchases, parties, events, or trips, allowing for easy collaboration and item management.

**This project has a Back End version** with a **Task List API**, using Node.js and Express to manage server logic and facilitate communication between users. You can find the API [in this repository](https://github.com/harrisondaniell/todo-list-API.git).

- Each list contains multiple items that can be marked as purchased or deleted.

### Adding and Removing Items

- It is possible to edit or remove items at any time.

### Sharing Lists
- Share lists with other users via a link or email invitation.
